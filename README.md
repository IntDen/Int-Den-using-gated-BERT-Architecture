# Int-Den-using-gated-BERT-Architecture
A robust denoising method for removing noises from the text generated from OCR is of utmost importance to improve data quality. We devise a method for different noise corrections from English texts. Proposed a modified Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture (built on top of BERT model) that uses a gating mechanism to detect types of corrections required and accordingly corrects texts irrespective of the types of noises
